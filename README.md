# Sorting-Algorithms-Analyzer
### I made this program to help me with research in one of my classes at the university.

Simple console app that analysis the number of comparisons of two sorting algorithms ( Heap Sort, Quick Sort )  
  The program uses two sorting algorithms on the same array and returns the K - smallest numbers of the array and the number of comparisons that each algorithm has made.  
    I added a PDF file (in Hebrew) with more depth research about the number of comparisons each algorithm need to make and which algorithm is better to use in each case
