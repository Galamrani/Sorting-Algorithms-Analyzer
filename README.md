# Sorting-Algorithms-Analyzer
### I made this program to help me with a research in one of my classes in the university.

Simple console app that analysis the number of comparisons of two sorting algorithms ( Heap Sort , Quick Sort )

The program use two sorting algorithms on the same array 
and returning the K - smallest numbers of the array and the number of comparisons that each algorithm have made.
I added a PDF file (in hebrew) with more depth research about the number of comparisons each algorithm need to make
and which algorithm is better to use in each case
